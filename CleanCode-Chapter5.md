# Chapter 5 -  Formatting

Code formatting is important. It is too important to ignore and it is too important to treat religiously. Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developerâ€™s first order of business.

### Vertical Formatting

#### Vertical Openness Between Concepts

This concept consist in how to you separate concepts in your code, In the next example we can appreciate it.

```java
package fitnesse.wikitext.widgets;

import java.util.regex.*;

public class BoldWidget extends ParentWidget {
  public static final String REGEXP = "'''.+?'''";
  private static final Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("'''(.+?)'''",
      Pattern.MULTILINE + Pattern.DOTALL
      );

  public BoldWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text) throws Exception {
    super(parent);
    Matcher match = pattern.matcher(text);
    match.find();
    addChildWidgets(match.group(1));
  }

  public String render() throws Exception {
    StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer("<b>");
    html.append(childHtml()).append("</b>");
    return html.toString();
  }
}
```

```java
package fitnesse.wikitext.widgets;
import java.util.regex.*;
public class BoldWidget extends ParentWidget {
  public static final String REGEXP = "'''.+?'''";
  private static final Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("'''(.+?)'''",
  Pattern.MULTILINE + Pattern.DOTALL);
  public BoldWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text) throws Exception {
    super(parent);
    Matcher match = pattern.matcher(text); match.find(); addChildWidgets(match.group(1));
  }
  public String render() throws Exception { StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer("<b>"); html.append(childHtml()).append("</b>"); return html.toString();
  }
}
```

As you can see, the readability of the first example is greater than that of the second.

#### Vertical Density

The vertical density implies close association. So lines of code that are tightly related should appear vertically dense. Check the follow example:

```Java
public class ReporterConfig {

	/**
	 * The class name of the reporter listener */
	private String m_className;

	/**
	 * The properties of the reporter listener */
	private List<Property> m_properties = new ArrayList<Property>();

	public void addProperty(Property property) { m_properties.add(property);
	}
```

```java
public class ReporterConfig {
  private String m_className;
  private List<Property> m_properties = new ArrayList<Property>();

  public void addProperty(Property property) {
    m_properties.add(property);
  }
}
```

The second code it's much easier to read. It fits in an "eye-full".

#### Vertical Distance

**Variable Declarations**. Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible. Because our functions are very short, local variables should appear at the top of each function,

**Instance variables**, on the other hand, should be declared at the top of the class. This should not increase the vertical distance of these variables, because in a well-designed class, they are used by many, if not all, of the methods of the class.

There have been many debates over where instance variables should go. In C++ we commonly practiced the so-called scissors rule, which put all the instance variables at the bottom. The common convention in Java, however, is to put them all at the top of the class. I see no reason to follow any other convention. The important thing is for the instance variables to be declared in one well-known place. Everybody should know where to go to see the declarations.

**Dependent Functions**. If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee, if at all possible. This gives the program a natural flow. If the convention is followed reliably, readers will be able to trust that function definitions will follow shortly after their use.

**Conceptual Affinity**. Certain bits of code want to be near other bits. They have a certain conceptual affinity. The stronger that affinity, the less vertical distance there should be between them.

#### Vertical Ordering

In general we want function call dependencies to point in the downward direction. That is, a function that is called should be below a function that does the calling. This creates a nice flow down the source code module from high level to low level. _(This is the exact opposite of languages like Pascal, C, and C++ that enforce functions to be defined, or at least declared, before they are used)_

### Horizontal Formatting

#### Horizontal Openness and Density

We use horizontal white space to associate things that are strongly related and disassociate things that are more weakly related. Example:

```java
private void measureLine(String line) {
  lineCount++;
  int lineSize = line.length();
  totalChars += lineSize;
  lineWidthHistogram.addLine(lineSize, lineCount);
  recordWidestLine(lineSize);
}
```

Assignment statements have two distinct and major elements: the left side and the right side. The spaces make that separation obvious.

#### Horizontal Alignment

```java
public class Example implements Base
{
  private   Socket      socket;
  private   inputStream input;
  protected long        requestProgress;

  public Expediter(Socket      s,
                   inputStream input) {
    this.socket =     s;
    this.input  =     input;
  }
}
```

In modern languages this type of alignment is not useful. The alignment seems to emphasize the wrong things and leads my eye away from the true intent.

```java
public class Example implements Base
{
  private Socket socket;
  private inputStream input;
  protected longrequestProgress;

  public Expediter(Socket s, inputStream input) {

    this.socket = s;
    this.input = input;
  }
}
```

This is a better approach.

### Indentation

The indentation it's important because help us to have a visible hierarchy and well defined blocks.

### Team Rules

Every programmer has his own favorite formatting rules, but if he works in a team, then the team rules.

A team of developers should agree upon a single formatting style, and then every member of that team should use that style. We want the software to have a consistent style. We don't want it to appear to have been written by a bunch of disagreeing individuals.
